ColdFire Studio requires free MS Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition to build.
Source code has been successfully built on Windows 10.

External dependencies:
- C++ std library (included with VS)
- Windows SDK (cames with VS installation?)
- boost libraries 1.65.1 (www.boost.org)
- WiX Toolkit (wixtoolset.org)
- Microsoft HTML Help Workshop 1.3

Included dependencies:
- Scintilla editor (http://www.scintilla.org/)
- HexView editor (https://github.com/strobejb/HexEdit)
- const_string implementation
- UART and timer implementation from ColdFire simulator by David Grant
- CSizingControlBarCF docking bars

Install Wix Installer and VS Wix Extension to build setup app.

Copy boost 1.65.1 to a location of your choice and modify Common.props file to point to it.
By default I look for it outside of the ColdFireStudio folder: $(SolutionDir)..\..\include\boost_1_65_1

Open ColdFireStudio.sln in Visual Studio 2017, choose desired configuration, and build all projects.
Executables are placed in 'bin' folder. To run they need access to two folders:
'Config' and 'Monitor'. Config contain config.ini with simulator configuration, while Monitor
contains CF binary program used to control execution of user programs.
In VS this is accomplished by setting working directory to the solution folder.

To install CF Studio open installer file from Setup/bin folder. Use either x64-Release or x86-Release flavor.

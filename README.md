# ColdFireStudio
Integrated ColdFire MCUs macro assembler and simulator.
Write programs in ColdFire assembly or load binary code and test them in a simulator.

ColdFire Studio is an integrated macro assembler and simulator for a series of ColdFire microcontrollers and microprocessors. It supports instruction sets A, B, and C (ISA_A, ISA_B, ISA_C). Various memory configurations are possible through the config file. Binary files can be loaded directly into simulator.

The aim of this project is to provide simple tool for experimenting with ColdFire assembly. Integrated simulator and debugger can be used to step through the source code.

This project is in early stages and contains many bugs. MAC/EMAC/FPU are not implemented. Very few of the many CF-specific peripherals are simulated.
